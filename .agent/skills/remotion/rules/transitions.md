## TransitionSeries

`<TransitionSeries>` arranges scenes and supports two ways to enhance the cut point between them:

- **Transitions** (`<TransitionSeries.Transition>`) — crossfade, slide, wipe, etc. between two scenes. Shortens the timeline because both scenes play simultaneously during the transition.
- **Overlays** (`<TransitionSeries.Overlay>`) — render an effect (e.g. a light leak) on top of the cut point without shortening the timeline.

Children are absolutely positioned.

## Prerequisites

```bash
npx remotion add @remotion/transitions
```

## Transition example

```tsx
import { TransitionSeries, linearTiming } from "@remotion/transitions";
import { fade } from "@remotion/transitions/fade";

<TransitionSeries>
  <TransitionSeries.Sequence durationInFrames={60}>
    <SceneA />
  </TransitionSeries.Sequence>
  <TransitionSeries.Transition
    presentation={fade()}
    timing={linearTiming({ durationInFrames: 15 })}
  />
  <TransitionSeries.Sequence durationInFrames={60}>
    <SceneB />
  </TransitionSeries.Sequence>
</TransitionSeries>;
```

## Available transition types

Import transitions from their respective modules:

```tsx
import { fade } from "@remotion/transitions/fade";
import { slide } from "@remotion/transitions/slide";
import { wipe } from "@remotion/transitions/wipe";
import { flip } from "@remotion/transitions/flip";
import { clockWipe } from "@remotion/transitions/clock-wipe";
```

## Slide transition with direction

```tsx
import { slide } from "@remotion/transitions/slide";

<TransitionSeries.Transition
  presentation={slide({ direction: "from-left" })}
  timing={linearTiming({ durationInFrames: 20 })}
/>;
```

Directions: `"from-left"`, `"from-right"`, `"from-top"`, `"from-bottom"`

## Timing options

```tsx
import { linearTiming, springTiming } from "@remotion/transitions";

// Linear timing - constant speed
linearTiming({ durationInFrames: 20 });

// Spring timing - organic motion
springTiming({ config: { damping: 200 }, durationInFrames: 25 });
```

## Duration calculation

Transitions overlap adjacent scenes, so the total composition length is **shorter** than the sum of all sequence durations. Overlays do **not** affect the total duration.

For example, with two 60-frame sequences and a 15-frame transition:

- Without transitions: `60 + 60 = 120` frames
- With transition: `60 + 60 - 15 = 105` frames
